## Christmas Word Search

Create a program that solves the Christmas word search!

Your program should allow the user to enter a word to guess, then search through the letters to see if the word is there.

- If the word is found, print the position of the first letter (this will be the row and column indexes), as well as the direction the word goes in (up, down, left, right, or diagonal).
- If the word is not found, you can simply print "not found".

Here are some words to try, which your program _should_ be able to find:

- ANGEL
- CARD
- CHEER
- EGGNOG
- FAMILY
- FESTIVE
- HOLIDAY
- NORTHPOLE
- ORNAMENTS
- PRESENTS
- REINDEER
- SLEIGH
- SNOWMAN
- TREE
- WREATH
